**# Emergency Help & Rescue Management System**

A console-based application designed to facilitate the management of emergency services and user interactions during crises. This system allows users to request help from various emergency services and provides an admin interface for monitoring and managing user requests.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
```


## üìù Description
The Emergency Help & Rescue Management System helps users organize their emergency requests in a terminal window. Each request stores:

- **Username** (string)
- **Password** (string)
- **Emergency Service** (string)
- **Location** (string)
- **Contact Number** (string)
- **Issue Description** (string)
- **Request Status** (pending/completed)

All changes are saved to `users.txt` and `info.txt`, ensuring that user data persists between runs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Terminal / Command Prompt
- (Optional) `make` if you prefer using a Makefile

## üöÄ Usage
### Running the Executable
1. **Windows**: Compile and run in Command Prompt:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c user.c admin.c services.c utils.c -o emergency_rescue
   emergency_rescue.exe
   ```

2. **Linux / macOS**:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c user.c admin.c services.c utils.c -o emergency_rescue
   ./emergency_rescue
   ```

### Basic Workflow
1. **Sign Up**: Users can create an account with a username and password.
2. **Login**: Users log in to access their dashboard.
3. **View Emergency Services**: Users can view a list of available emergency services along with their contact information.
4. **Request Emergency Help**: Users select a service, provide their location and contact details, and describe their emergency issue.
5. **User  Dashboard**: Users can monitor their requests and view the status of their alerts.
6. **Logout**: Users can log out of the system.

### Notes
- If `users.txt` does not exist, it will be created automatically on the first sign-up.
- The system operates in a command-line interface (CLI) only.
